# EHills!

EHills is an application for a complex multi-client auction system (think: Ebay). Within the repository, I have a  server application and a client application with supporting files for each

Some coding concepts I used:
  - Socket programming (TCP)
  - Multithreading
  - Observer/Observable interfaces
  - JavaFX GUI
  - Serialization
  - Encryption
